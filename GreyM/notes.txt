	What did I do last time?
	I added the TLS callbacks and it works fine.
	But, not for the RIMJOB DLL that calls the LdrpStaticTls...
	That does not work for some reason, no error message either

IAT REDIRECTION: https://forum.exetools.com/showthread.php?t=13620

IN THE LOADER SHELLCODE, INSTEAD OF ONLY CALL[RSP-8], RANDOMIZE IT BETWEEN A CALL AND A JUMP THAT SIMULATED A CALL BY PUSHING RET ADD TO STACK

TLS CALLBACK 1:
Fix the address in the tls callback 2
TLS CALLBACK 2:
Dynamically add a new TLS callback

OBJECTIVE

Remove imports in tls callback

Dynamically resolve them only if the imports are from native dlls, dont want to handle api sets


TODO:
	Add TLS callback
	Make the TLS callback add dynamic callback that executes code against debugger and shit

TODO: Consider using custom relocations instead, to when reversing in IDA, addresses would not be relocated to base address
	Example: Put all relocations in a specific section and relocate them in a TLS callback instead

TODO: Replace the pdb path with a link or something funny

TODO: Consider turning every instruction into several instructions
	Turn into garbage code?
	Turn into code that does one thing, than later on after more garbage is undoes that thing?

TODO: Find a better solution to find the default pe image base address, currently I am defining DLL in Interpreter main.h and hardcode the values

TODO: All the INT3 instructions between functions can be replaced with
BOGUS code to catch of disassemblers.
